# Email Validator


## Assignment

Implement a form on a web page that has a form field that accepts as input an email address and a submit button that uses a function in Javascript to validate the email address using regular expressions.

The function should accept as input a string variable representing an email address and return a boolean (true if the email address is valid, false otherwise).

## Solution

* In order to run the solution, download the zip or fork the repository.
* Navigate to the main folder in your terminal.
* Open the full path of the `index.html` file in your browser.
* Enjoy email validation checks!

### Plans for the Future

* Implement full testing using Jest.
